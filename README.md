A CLI number guessing game based upon Typescript colored with chalk which allows the user to guess the correct number between 1 and 12 ( both inclusive ), with a total number of tries upto 3.
This guess the number game is a short TypeScript/Node.js project

like adding more rounds or displaying the score.
